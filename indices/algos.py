def disruption_index(doi: str, graph: DiGraph) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the disruption index from Wu, Wang, and Evans.

    In short, the disruption index is the difference between the number of the articles citing
    `doi` but none of its children and the number of articles citing both `doi` and at least
    one of its children.

    Intuitively, a paper with values near 1 is "disruptive" in that the papers citing it don't
    cite the papers it cites, while a paper with a value near -1 is "developmental" in that
    the papers citing it also cite the papers it cites. Papers with values near zero are deemed
    neither disruptive nor developmental.

    Arguments
    ---------
    doi: The doi to calculate the disruption index for
    graph: The graph containing all citations

    Returns
    -------
    disruption - The disruption index for the given doi
